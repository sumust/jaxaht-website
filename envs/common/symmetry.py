"""Abstract base for env-level symmetries used by augmentation training.

A symmetry is an equivariance the policy can be augmented over: a permutation
of the env's color/agent/spatial coordinates that leaves task semantics
unchanged. SymmetryAugmentationWrapper samples a symmetry and applies it
to one agent's view + actions, so the policy learns to be robust to that
group's action.

Examples:
  HanabiColorSymmetry  — Hu et al. 2020 Other-Play (color permutation)
  OvercookedReflection — left-right reflection of layout coordinates
  LBFAgentPermutation  — agent-id permutation in the obs
