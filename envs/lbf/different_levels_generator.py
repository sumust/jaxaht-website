"""Generator that produces LBF grids with varied food levels.

When using the default RandomGenerator with force_coop=True, all food items
get the same level (sum of agent levels), so every fruit requires cooperation.
This generator instead ensures variety:
  - At least one fruit is soloable by each agent (level = that agent's level)
  - Remaining fruits require cooperation (level = combined agent levels)
  - The ordering is shuffled randomly each reset
